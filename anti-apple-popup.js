            <h2>Hello! It appears that you are using an Apple device.</h2>
            <p>If you're using an Apple device, it's worth considering a switch to a non-Apple alternative that offers better value, ethics, and innovation.<br>
            Apple's products are notoriously overpriced, often charging premium prices for hardware that competitors provide at a fraction of the cost with better specs.<br>
            Worse yet, Apple has a long history of questionable ethical practices, from failing to pay factory workers fair wages to engaging in aggressive tactics to prevent right-to-repair movementsâ€”forcing you to rely on their expensive services.<br>
            Their stance on privacy is also not as secure as they claim, with numerous reports suggesting they prioritize profits over user data protection.<br>
            Additionally, Apple has a habit of selling years-old hardware in "new" devices, misleading consumers into believing they are getting cutting-edge technology when, in reality, they're purchasing outdated components with a fresh coat of paint.<br>
            By switching to non-Apple alternatives, you can enjoy more transparency, fair pricing, and greater control over your devices, all while supporting companies that value ethical production and user freedom.</p>
